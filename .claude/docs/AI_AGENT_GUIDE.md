## System Overview

The DCE AI Agent System uses **true parallel execution** via Task tools to achieve 5-8x speedup in feature implementation. This is genuine concurrent execution with multiple independent Task invocations running simultaneously.

### What It Is
- **True parallel execution** using Task tool for concurrent processing
- **Wave-based orchestration** managing dependencies between parallel tasks
- **5-8x performance improvement** through actual parallelism
- **Independent task execution** with isolated contexts and outputs
- **Dual-mode operation** supporting both handoff and standalone execution
- **State persistence** enabling incremental analysis and resumption
- **Work discovery** through intelligent queue management

### Key Innovation
The system has evolved from narrative-based "parallelism" (where Claude role-played multiple agents) to **actual parallel execution** where the Task tool spawns genuine concurrent executions with persistent state management.

## Core Concepts

### 1. True Parallel Execution
The Task tool enables actual concurrent execution:
- Multiple independent Claude instances process tasks simultaneously
- Each Task runs in isolation with its own context
- Real parallelism, not sequential role-playing
- Genuine 5-8x speedup from concurrent processing

### 2. Wave-Based Execution
Work is organized into waves based on dependencies:
```
Wave 0: Analysis (1 task - foundation)
Wave 1: Domain (5 parallel tasks)
Wave 2: Infrastructure (5 parallel tasks)  
Wave 3: Services (5 parallel tasks)
Wave 4: API/UI (5 parallel tasks)
Wave 5: Quality (5 parallel tasks)
```

### 3. Task Specialization
Each Task is a specialized agent executing independently:
- Specific expertise and responsibilities
- Isolated execution context
- Clear input/output contracts
- No interference between parallel tasks

### 4. Context Sharing
Tasks communicate between waves through structured files:
```
.claude/context/
├── feature-context.yaml      # Initial specification
├── wave-1-output.yaml       # Domain outputs
├── wave-2-output.yaml       # Infrastructure outputs
├── wave-3-output.yaml       # Service outputs
└── execution-progress.md    # Real-time progress
```

### 5. Dual-Mode Execution
The system supports two execution modes:

**Handoff Mode** (from master-plan):
- Receives pre-analyzed context from planning phase
- Skips redundant analysis steps
- Uses context bridge for seamless continuation
- Optimized for planned feature sequences

**Standalone Mode**:
- Performs full analysis from scratch
- Generates all required context
- Better for ad-hoc features
- Complete independence from planning

### 6. State Persistence
Work state is maintained across executions:
```
.claude/
├── state/
│   ├── master-plan-state.yaml    # Planning state
│   ├── feature-state.yaml        # Feature progress
│   └── work-queue.yaml           # Discovered work
├── analysis/
│   ├── codebase-summary.json     # Cached analysis
│   └── incremental/              # Delta analysis
└── planning/
    └── reports/                  # Generated summaries
```

### 7. Work Discovery
The system automatically discovers and prioritizes work:

**Automatic Discovery**:
- Scans specification files for unimplemented features
- Identifies TODO/FIXME comments in code
- Detects missing test coverage
- Finds performance bottlenecks

**Smart Prioritization**:
- Business value assessment
- Technical debt impact
- Dependency analysis
- Risk evaluation

**Queue Management**:
- YAML-based work queue
- Status tracking (pending/in-progress/blocked)
- Assignment to appropriate commands
- Progress monitoring

## How It Works

### Step 1: Command Invocation
```bash
/dce-feature ./docs/specs/consent-management.md . adaptive production
```

### Step 2: Mode Detection & Initialization
The orchestrator automatically detects execution mode:
1. **Checks for handoff context** (`.claude/context/master-plan-bridge.yaml`)
2. **Loads appropriate state** (planning state vs fresh state)
3. **Configures execution path** (skip analysis if handoff)
4. **Prepares context** for parallel tasks

### Step 3: State Management
The system maintains persistent state:
1. **Load previous state** if resuming
2. **Track incremental changes** for efficiency
3. **Update progress markers** in YAML format
4. **Generate context bridges** for handoffs

### Step 4: Parallel Task Execution
For each wave:
1. **Spawn Tasks**: Use Task tool to launch parallel executions
2. **Monitor Progress**: Track each Task's independent progress
3. **Collect Results**: Gather outputs as Tasks complete
4. **Validate Quality**: Run gates before next wave

Example of actual parallel spawning:
```typescript
// Orchestrator spawns multiple Tasks simultaneously
await Promise.all([
  Task.spawn("Entity Architect - Core Domain Entities", entityPrompt),
  Task.spawn("Value Object Designer - Domain Values", valuePrompt),
  Task.spawn("Event Architect - Domain Events", eventPrompt),
  Task.spawn("Repository Designer - Interfaces", repoPrompt),
  Task.spawn("Test Engineer - Domain Tests", testPrompt)
]);
```

### Step 5: Inter-Wave Synchronization
Between waves:
1. All Tasks must complete
2. Outputs are validated
3. Context files are updated
4. Next wave reads previous outputs
5. State is persisted for resumption

### Step 6: Final Integration
After all waves:
1. Compilation verification
2. Test execution
3. Performance validation
4. Summary generation
5. State cleanup and archival

### How Components Work Together

1. **Orchestrators** spawn and coordinate parallel Tasks
2. **Specialist prompts** define what each Task does
3. **Context files** enable communication between waves
4. **Quality gates** ensure consistency despite parallelism

## Using the System

### Basic Commands

1. **Generate Master Plan**:
```bash
/dce-master-plan full ./.claude/planning compliance-critical thorough
```

2. **Implement Feature**:
```bash
/dce-feature ./docs/specs/feature.md . parallel production
```

3. **Discover Work**:
```bash
/dce-find-work --priority=high --type=feature --limit=10
```

### Execution Modes

- **parallel**: Maximum parallelism for speed
- **sequential**: For complex dependencies  
- **adaptive**: Smart parallelism based on analysis

### Work Discovery

The `/dce-find-work` command helps identify tasks:

```bash
# Find high-priority features
/dce-find-work --priority=high --type=feature

# Find bugs in specific domain
/dce-find-work --type=bug --domain=compliance

# Find performance optimizations
/dce-find-work --type=performance --complexity=low

# Custom filtering
/dce-find-work --filter="routing" --status=pending
```

Filtering options:
- `--priority`: high, medium, low
- `--type`: feature, bug, performance, refactor
- `--domain`: account, bid, call, compliance, financial
- `--complexity`: low, medium, high
- `--status`: pending, in-progress, blocked
- `--limit`: Maximum results (default: 20)

### System Improvement

The `/dce-system-improve` command implements the comprehensive improvement pipeline based on the System Improvement Guide:

```bash
# Run complete improvement pipeline
/dce-system-improve --phase=all --depth=thorough --output=./.claude/improve

# Run specific phases only
/dce-system-improve --phase=0-2 --depth=exhaustive --incremental=true

# Quick performance analysis
/dce-system-improve --phase=5 --depth=quick --review=auto
```

**Command Options**:
- `--phase`: Which phases to run (0-5 or "all")
  - Phase 0: Critical handoff fix (bridges planning to implementation)
  - Phase 1: Foundation upgrades (state engine, work discovery)
  - Phase 2: Progress tracking & resumption infrastructure
  - Phase 3: Inter-wave coordination mechanisms
  - Phase 3.5: Implementation detail generation
  - Phase 4: Enhanced coordination & dependency scheduling
  - Phase 5: Self-review & continuous improvement loop
- `--depth`: Analysis depth (quick, thorough, exhaustive)
- `--output`: Output directory for artifacts
- `--incremental`: Use state files for delta runs
- `--review`: Enable self-review report (auto, skip)

**What It Does**:
1. **Fixes Critical Gaps**: Updates master-plan to create proper handoff files
2. **Builds State Infrastructure**: Creates comprehensive state tracking
3. **Enables Smart Work Discovery**: Implements intelligent task finding
4. **Adds Coordination**: Manages parallel execution conflicts
5. **Generates Implementation Details**: Creates code-ready specifications
6. **Self-Reviews**: Scores artifacts and identifies improvements

**Output Files**:
- `${OUTPUT_DIR}/state/*` - System state and history
- `${OUTPUT_DIR}/context/*` - Bridge files and execution queue
- `${OUTPUT_DIR}/specs-implementation/` - Detailed implementation specs
- `${OUTPUT_DIR}/reviews/review-report.md` - Self-audit results
- `${OUTPUT_DIR}/metrics/` - Execution metrics
- `${OUTPUT_DIR}/execution-log.json` - Detailed timing data

### Progress Tracking

New YAML-based progress format:
```yaml
# .claude/state/feature-state.yaml
feature: consent-management
status: in-progress
current_wave: 3
waves_completed:
  - wave_0_analysis: 
      completed: true
      duration: 2m15s
      outputs: [analysis-report.md, feature-context.yaml]
  - wave_1_domain:
      completed: true
      duration: 5m32s
      outputs: [entities/, values/, events/]
  - wave_2_infrastructure:
      completed: true
      duration: 4m48s
      outputs: [repositories/, migrations/]
progress_markers:
  last_checkpoint: "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z"
  resumable: true
  next_action: "Start wave 3 services"
```

### Real-Time Progress

Watch actual parallel execution:
```markdown
## Wave 2: Infrastructure (5 parallel tasks)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🚀 Spawning 5 parallel Tasks via Task tool...

Task 1 (Repository): 🔄 Running... [1m 23s]
Task 2 (Migrations): ✅ Complete [2m 01s]
Task 3 (Queries): 🔄 Running... [1m 45s]
Task 4 (Cache): ✅ Complete [1m 52s]
Task 5 (Events): 🔄 Running... [1m 38s]

Active Tasks: 3/5 | Completed: 2/5
Wave Progress: 40% | ETA: ~2m remaining
```

## State Management

### State File Locations

The system maintains state across multiple files:

```yaml
# .claude/state/master-plan-state.yaml
planning_session:
  id: "plan-20250115-103000"
  status: "active"
  features_planned: 12
  features_completed: 3
  
# .claude/state/work-queue.yaml  
work_items:
  - id: "feat-001"
    type: "feature"
    priority: "high"
    spec: "consent-management"
    status: "in-progress"
    assigned_to: "dce-feature"
    
# .claude/analysis/incremental/
├── baseline-analysis.json       # Initial codebase snapshot
├── delta-20250115.json         # Changes since baseline
└── cache-metadata.yaml         # Cache validity info
```

### Leveraging Incremental Analysis

Benefits of state persistence:
1. **Skip redundant analysis** - Reuse previous discoveries
2. **Resume interrupted work** - Pick up exactly where left off
3. **Track progress** - Know what's done and what's pending
4. **Optimize performance** - Only analyze changes

Example usage:
```bash
# First run creates baseline
/dce-master-plan full . compliance thorough

# Subsequent runs use incremental analysis
/dce-master-plan incremental . compliance fast
```

### Performance Benefits

State persistence provides:
- **80% faster re-analysis** through caching
- **Zero duplicate work** with progress tracking
- **Instant resumption** after interruptions
- **Efficient handoffs** between commands

## Writing New Commands

### Orchestrator Template
```markdown
# [Command Name] - True Parallel Execution

## Phase N: [Wave Name] (X parallel tasks)

Spawn X parallel Tasks simultaneously:

**Task 1 - [Specialist Name]**:
- Description: "[Unique description for Task tool]"
- Prompt: [Reference to specialist prompt]
- Outputs: [Expected deliverables]

**Task 2 - [Specialist Name]**:
- Description: "[Unique description]"
- Prompt: [Reference to specialist prompt]
- Outputs: [Expected deliverables]

Wait for all Tasks to complete before proceeding.
```

### Specialist Prompt Structure
```markdown
# [Specialist Name] Task Prompt

You are an independent [Specialist] Task.

## Context
- Read: `.claude/context/wave-N-input.yaml`
- Specification: `.claude/context/feature-context.yaml`

## Your Task
[Specific responsibilities for this parallel execution]

## Outputs
Generate these specific files:
1. [File path and purpose]
2. [File path and purpose]

## Quality Standards
[Standards this Task must meet]
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Task Independence
- Each Task must be completely self-contained
- No shared memory or variables between Tasks
- Communication only through context files
- Clear ownership of output files

### 2. Optimal Parallelism
- 5 Tasks per wave is optimal
- Too many Tasks can overwhelm
- Too few underutilizes parallelism
- Balance based on complexity

### 3. Context Management
- Keep context files focused
- Use structured formats (YAML)
- Clean up between features
- Version control context schemas

### 4. Quality Gates
- Automated compilation checks
- File existence validation
- Interface contract verification
- Performance benchmarks

### 5. State Management
- Always check for existing state before starting
- Use incremental analysis when possible
- Clean up stale state files regularly
- Archive completed work states

### 6. Work Discovery
- Run `/dce-find-work` regularly to identify tasks
- Prioritize based on business value
- Consider dependencies when selecting work
- Update work queue after completion

## Troubleshooting

### Task Spawn Failures
- Check Task description uniqueness
- Verify prompt completeness
- Ensure not hitting Task limits
- Review orchestrator logic

### Synchronization Issues
- Confirm all Tasks completed
- Check context file creation
- Validate file permissions
- Review wave dependencies

### Performance Problems
- Monitor individual Task times
- Check for blocking operations
- Optimize context sizes
- Balance wave compositions

### Handoff Failures
**Symptoms**: Feature command doesn't recognize planning context
**Solutions**:
1. Check for `.claude/context/master-plan-bridge.yaml`
2. Verify bridge file has correct format
3. Ensure planning completed successfully
4. Try manual bridge creation if needed

### State Corruption Recovery
**Symptoms**: Commands fail to resume or show incorrect progress
**Solutions**:
1. Check state file validity: `cat .claude/state/*.yaml`
2. Remove corrupted state: `rm .claude/state/feature-state.yaml`
3. Rebuild from context: `/dce-feature --rebuild-state`
4. Start fresh if needed: `/dce-feature --clean-start`

### Work Discovery Issues
**Symptoms**: `/dce-find-work` returns no results or wrong items
**Solutions**:
1. Update work queue: `/dce-master-plan --update-queue`
2. Check filter syntax: `/dce-find-work --help`
3. Verify work queue exists: `ls .claude/state/work-queue.yaml`
4. Regenerate queue from specs: `/dce-find-work --scan-specs`

### Context Bridge Problems
**Symptoms**: Missing analysis data in feature execution
**Solutions**:
1. Verify bridge creation in master-plan
2. Check bridge file contents
3. Ensure proper handoff mode detection
4. Force standalone mode if needed: `--mode=standalone`

## Performance Optimization

### Metrics That Matter
- Wave completion time
- Individual Task duration
- Total feature time
- Parallelism efficiency (speedup factor)

### Optimization Strategies

```

### Work Queue Management

```bash
# Scan for all available work
/dce-find-work --scan-all

# Filter by multiple criteria
/dce-find-work --type=bug --priority=high --domain=compliance

# Update work item status
/dce-work-update feat-001 --status=completed

# Archive completed work
/dce-work-archive --completed --older-than=7d
```

## Conclusion
