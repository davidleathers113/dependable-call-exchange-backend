# DCE Smart Work Discovery

## Overview

The DCE Smart Work Discovery system is an intelligent feature that helps developers and teams identify the most valuable work to focus on at any given time. It solves the common problem of "what should I work on next?" by analyzing project readiness, dependencies, and business value to surface optimal work items.

### Problems It Solves

1. **Decision Paralysis**: When faced with a large backlog, developers often struggle to choose the most impactful work
2. **Hidden Dependencies**: Work that seems ready might be blocked by unfinished dependencies
3. **Resource Conflicts**: Multiple developers working on conflicting areas without coordination
4. **Suboptimal Prioritization**: Working on low-value items while high-value work sits ready

### Efficiency Improvements

- **Reduced Context Switching**: Find work that matches your current context and expertise
- **Maximize Throughput**: Identify work that can be done in parallel
- **Minimize Blockers**: Only surfaces work that's actually ready to start
- **Value-Driven Development**: Prioritizes based on business impact

### Integration with Queue Management

The work discovery system feeds directly into the DCE queue management system:
- Discovered work can be immediately queued with `/dce-queue add`
- Queue optimization considers discovered work for parallelization
- Progress tracking includes discovered but not-yet-queued items

## /dce-find-work Command

The `/dce-find-work` command is your intelligent assistant for discovering optimal work items.

### Command Syntax

```bash
/dce-find-work [options]

Options:
  --domain <name>        Filter by specific domain (e.g., compliance, financial)
  --complexity <level>   Filter by complexity (low, medium, high)
  --duration <time>      Maximum estimated duration (e.g., 2h, 1d, 1w)
  --skills <list>        Required skills (comma-separated)
  --team-size <n>        Number of available developers
  --include-blocked      Include work with resolvable blockers
  --format <type>        Output format (table, json, markdown)
  --limit <n>            Maximum results to return (default: 10)
```

### Filtering Criteria

#### Domain Filtering
```bash
# Find all compliance-related work
/dce-find-work --domain compliance

# Find work in multiple domains
/dce-find-work --domain "compliance,financial"
```

#### Complexity and Duration
```bash
# Quick wins - low complexity, short duration
/dce-find-work --complexity low --duration 4h

# Sprint-sized work
/dce-find-work --duration 1w --complexity medium
```

#### Skill Matching
```bash
# Find Go backend work
/dce-find-work --skills "go,backend,postgresql"

# Find work requiring specific expertise
/dce-find-work --skills "performance,optimization"
```

### Output Formats

## Readiness Scoring Algorithm

The readiness score (0-100%) indicates how ready a piece of work is to be started immediately.

### Calculation Components

1. **Dependency Completion (40%)**
   - All dependencies complete: 40%
   - Some dependencies in progress: 20-35%
   - Critical dependencies blocked: 0-15%

2. **Specification Clarity (20%)**
   - Full specifications available: 20%
   - Partial specifications: 10-15%
   - Minimal specifications: 5%

3. **Resource Availability (20%)**
   - All required resources available: 20%
   - Most resources available: 10-15%
   - Limited resources: 5%

4. **Technical Prerequisites (20%)**
   - Infrastructure ready: 10%
   - Required tools/libraries available: 10%

### Dependency Checking

```yaml
dependency_check:
  hard_dependencies:
    - status: must be "completed" or "not_required"
    - weight: blocks entirely if not met
  
  soft_dependencies:
    - status: can be "in_progress"
    - weight: reduces readiness score
  
  future_dependencies:
    - status: work that will depend on this
    - weight: increases priority if many items waiting
```

### Resource Availability

```yaml
resources:
  human:
    - required_skills: ["go", "postgresql"]
    - team_availability: 2 developers
    - domain_expertise: compliance specialist
  
  technical:
    - database_capacity: available
    - api_rate_limits: sufficient
    - third_party_services: configured
  
  time:
    - deadline_proximity: 30 days
    - sprint_capacity: 40%
```
