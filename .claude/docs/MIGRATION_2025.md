# Claude Command System Migration - January 2025

## Changes Made

1. **Test Commands Moved**
   - `claude-testing-orchestrator.md` → `test/.claude/commands/`
   - `claude-testing-review.md` → `test/.claude/commands/`

2. **Duplicate Commands Removed**
   - `dce-feature-parallel.md` - Use `/dce-feature` with parallel mode
   - `dce-feature-consent.md` - Use `/dce-feature` with consent spec
   - `dce-master-plan-compliance.md` - Use `/dce-master-plan` with compliance-critical priority
   - `orchestrator.md` - Generic template, not needed

3. **Runtime Files Gitignored**
   - `.claude/context/` - Runtime context files
   - `.claude/planning/master-plan.md` - Generated plans
   - `.claude/planning/execute-plan.sh` - Generated scripts

## Migration Instructions

If you were using removed commands:
- Replace `/dce-feature-consent` with `/dce-feature <spec_file> . adaptive production`
- Replace `/dce-master-plan-compliance` with `/dce-master-plan full . compliance-critical thorough`

Test commands are now in `test/.claude/commands/` for better organization.

## Rationale

This reorganization follows the architecture outlined in SYSTEM_SUMMARY.md:
- Separates test commands from project commands for clarity
- Removes duplicate commands that were hardcoded variants of parameterized commands
- Ensures runtime artifacts are not committed to version control
- Improves maintainability by having a single source of truth for each command

## Command Summary

**Project Commands** (in `.claude/commands/`):
- `/dce-master-plan` - Master planning and analysis
- `/dce-feature` - Feature implementation

**Test Commands** (in `test/.claude/commands/`):
- `claude-testing-orchestrator` - Testing orchestrator for Claude Code
- `claude-testing-review` - Testing review and implementation
