# **DCE FEATURE SPECIFICATION EXECUTOR (True Parallel Execution)**

Ultra-think about executing feature specifications using REAL PARALLEL EXECUTION via Task tools. You will spawn multiple specialized agents SIMULTANEOUSLY to achieve 5-8x faster implementation than sequential approaches.

## üöÄ **PARALLEL EXECUTION ADVANTAGE**

**CRITICAL**: This executor uses TRUE PARALLEL EXECUTION, not narrative parallelism:
- **5-8x faster implementation** than sequential execution
- **Genuine concurrent Tasks** via Task tool invocations
- **Independent specialist execution** with no blocking
- **Wave-based synchronization** for dependency management

## **COMMAND VARIABLES**

```
spec_file: $ARGUMENTS          # Path to feature specification
output_dir: $ARGUMENTS         # Where to generate code
execution_mode: $ARGUMENTS     # parallel|sequential|adaptive
quality_level: $ARGUMENTS      # draft|production|bulletproof
```

## **ARGUMENT PARSING**

Parse from "$ARGUMENTS":
1. `spec_file` - Path to the feature specification file
   Examples: "specs/consent-management-v2.md", "specs/dynamic-pricing.md"
   
2. `output_dir` - Directory for generated code (default: project root following DCE structure)
   
3. `execution_mode` - How to coordinate Tasks (default: adaptive)
   Options: parallel (maximum speed), sequential (safer), adaptive (smart dependencies)
   
4. `quality_level` - Code quality target (default: production)
   Options: draft (quick prototype), production (normal), bulletproof (maximum quality)

## **PHASE 1: SPECIFICATION ANALYSIS**

**Deep Spec Understanding Protocol:**

Read and analyze the specification file to extract all requirements. Create a shared context file at `.claude/context/feature-implementation.yaml` containing:

```yaml
feature_overview:
  name: [from spec]
  domain: [target domain]
  priority: [critical|high|medium]
  
technical_requirements:
  entities: [list of entities to create]
  value_objects: [list of value objects]
  services: [required services]
  apis: [endpoints to implement]
  repositories: [data access needs]
  
quality_targets:
  performance: [latency requirements]
  security: [auth/authz needs]
  compliance: [TCPA/GDPR requirements]
  testing: [coverage targets]
```

2. Run `go build -gcflags="-e" ./...` to check compilation
3. Validate expected outputs exist
4. Update shared context for next wave
5. Only proceed if quality gates pass

## **EXECUTION MONITORING**

Track progress in `.claude/context/execution-progress.md`:

```markdown
## Feature: [Name] - Parallel Execution Progress

### Wave 0: Analysis ‚úÖ (2 min)
- [x] Specification analyzed
- [x] Dependencies mapped
- [x] Execution plan created

### Wave 1: Domain (5 Tasks) üîÑ (3 min)
- [x] Task 1: Domain Expert - 2 entities created
- [x] Task 2: Value Designer - 3 value objects
- [x] Task 3: Event Architect - 5 events defined
- [ ] Task 4: Repository Designer - In progress...
- [x] Task 5: Domain Tester - 95% coverage

### Wave 2: Infrastructure (5 Tasks) ‚è∏Ô∏è
- Waiting for Wave 1 completion...

### Performance Metrics
- Total elapsed: 5 minutes
- Parallel speedup: 6.2x
- Tasks completed: 9/25
```

## **QUALITY GATES**

Each wave must pass before proceeding:
- **Compilation**: No errors with `go build -gcflags="-e"`
- **Linting**: golangci-lint passes
- **Tests**: All unit tests green
- **Coverage**: Meets targets (80%+ minimum)
- **Performance**: Sub-millisecond for critical paths

## **EXECUTION PATTERNS BY MODE**

### Parallel Mode (Maximum Speed)
- Launch all waves immediately
- No dependency checking
- Risk of integration issues
- Best for prototypes

### Sequential Mode (Maximum Safety)
- Complete wave before starting next
- Full validation between waves
- Slower but safer
- Best for critical features

### Adaptive Mode (Recommended)
- Analyze dependencies
- Parallelize within waves
- Sequential between dependent waves
- Best balance of speed and safety

## **CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS**

1. **Task Independence**: Each Task must be self-contained
2. **Clear Boundaries**: No overlap between Task responsibilities  
3. **Context Isolation**: Tasks cannot communicate during execution
4. **Wave Validation**: Always validate before next wave
5. **Progress Tracking**: Monitor all Task completions

Begin execution by analyzing the specification, then unleash the power of TRUE PARALLEL EXECUTION with coordinated Task waves!
