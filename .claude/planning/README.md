# DCE Planning Directory

This directory contains the master plans and feature specifications generated by the DCE infinite loop system.

## Directory Structure

```
.claude/planning/
├── README.md                 # This file
├── master-plan.md           # Generated master plan (created by /dce-master-plan)
├── templates/               # Specification templates and examples
│   ├── example.md           # Basic specification template

│   └── example-spec-2.md    # Extended specification template
└── execute-plan.sh          # Execution script (generated)
```

**Note**: Actual feature specifications are stored in `./.claude/planning/specs/` following standard documentation conventions.

## Quick Start

1. **Generate a Master Plan**:
   ```bash
   /dce-master-plan full ./.claude/planning compliance-critical thorough
   ```

2. **Review the Generated Plan**:
   - Open `master-plan.md` to see the roadmap
   - Check `./.claude/planning/specs/` for actual feature specifications

3. **Execute a Feature**:
   ```bash
   /dce-feature ../.claude/planning/specs/consent-management-system.md . adaptive production
   ```

## Available Commands

### Master Planner (`/dce-master-plan`)
Analyzes your codebase and generates a comprehensive development plan.

**Syntax**: `/dce-master-plan [scope] [output_dir] [priority] [depth]`

**Arguments**:
- `scope`: full | domain-gaps | service-coverage | security-audit | performance-bottlenecks
- `output_dir`: Where to save outputs (default: ./.claude/planning)
- `priority`: revenue-generation | compliance-critical | performance-optimization | reliability
- `depth`: quick | thorough | exhaustive

### Feature Executor (`/dce-feature`)
Implements a feature from its specification file.

**Syntax**: `/dce-feature [spec_file] [output_dir] [mode] [quality]`

**Arguments**:
- `spec_file`: Path to feature specification
- `output_dir`: Where to generate code (default: project root)
- `mode`: parallel | sequential | adaptive
- `quality`: draft | production | bulletproof

## Specification Format

Each specification follows this structure:

```yaml
---
feature: Feature Name
domain: Target Domain
priority: critical|high|medium|low
effort: small|medium|large|xlarge
type: feature|enhancement|bug-fix|refactor
---

# Feature Specification: [Name]

## Overview
[Description and business value]

## Business Requirements
[What the feature must accomplish]

## Technical Specification
[Detailed implementation requirements]

## Testing Strategy
[How to validate the feature]

[Additional sections as needed]
```

## Workflow Examples

### Compliance Sprint
```bash
# Focus on compliance features
/dce-master-plan full ./.claude/planning compliance-critical exhaustive

# Execute critical compliance features
/dce-feature ./.claude/planning/specs/tcpa-prevention.md . sequential bulletproof
/dce-feature ./.claude/planning/specs/gdpr-compliance.md . sequential bulletproof
```

### Performance Optimization
```bash
# Analyze performance bottlenecks
/dce-master-plan performance-bottlenecks ./.claude/planning performance-optimization thorough

# Execute optimization features
/dce-feature ./.claude/planning/specs/query-optimization.md . adaptive production
/dce-feature ./.claude/planning/specs/cache-strategy.md . adaptive production
```

### New Feature Development
```bash
# Plan new features with revenue focus
/dce-master-plan full ./.claude/planning revenue-generation thorough

# Implement top priority feature
/dce-feature ./.claude/planning/specs/dynamic-pricing.md . adaptive production
```

## Tips

1. **Start with Analysis**: Always run the master planner first to understand current state
2. **Review Specifications**: Check generated specs before execution
3. **Use Appropriate Modes**: 
   - `sequential` for complex dependencies
   - `parallel` for speed
   - `adaptive` for balanced approach
4. **Choose Quality Levels**:
   - `draft` for prototypes
   - `production` for most features  
   - `bulletproof` for critical features
5. **Test Generated Code**: Always run tests after generation
   ```bash
   make test
   make lint
   make bench
   ```

## Integration with Development Workflow

The planning directory integrates with your Git workflow:

```bash
# After planning
git add .claude/planning/
git commit -m "chore: update development plan for Q1"

# After implementing features
git add .
git commit -m "feat: implement consent management from .claude/planning/specs/consent-management-v2.md"
```

## Continuous Planning

Re-run the master planner periodically to:
- Identify new opportunities
- Update priorities based on completed work
- Discover technical debt
- Plan refactoring efforts

```bash
# Weekly planning update
/dce-master-plan full ./.claude/planning balanced quick
```
