## Dependency Management Strategies

### 1. Parallel Work Streams

**Stream A: Compliance** (Weeks 1-6)
- Consent â†’ DNC â†’ Audit â†’ Compliance Service

**Stream B: Platform** (Weeks 3-8)  
- Events â†’ Financial â†’ Analytics

**Stream C: Enhancement** (Weeks 9-16)
- Pricing â†’ Fraud â†’ Campaign â†’ Scale

### 2. Risk Mitigation Tactics

| Risk | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|-------------------|
| Event system delays | Start design in Week 2, prototype early |
| Compliance complexity | Hire consultant Week 1 |
| ML model accuracy | Use simple rules first, enhance later |
| Integration issues | Continuous testing from Week 3 |

### 3. Acceleration Opportunities

- **Hire Senior Architect**: Can parallelize event implementation
- **Use Existing Libraries**: Faster encryption, event sourcing
- **Cloud Services**: Managed Kafka, ML platforms
- **Pair Programming**: Knowledge transfer and quality

## Contingency Planning

### If Domain Events Delayed
- Continue with direct service integration
- Retrofit events in Phase 2
- Use change data capture for audit

### If ML Models Underperform  
- Fall back to rule-based systems
- Iterate on models in production
- Hire ML consultant

### If Compliance Complex
- Focus on US federal rules first
- Add states incrementally
- Defer international

## Conclusion

This timeline provides a realistic 16-week path from compliance crisis to platform excellence. The dependency mapping ensures smooth flow between features while the parallel streams maximize velocity. Regular checkpoints allow for course correction while contingency plans handle common risks.

**Critical Insight**: Weeks 1-2 are make-or-break for compliance. Everything else can be adjusted, but these emergency fixes must succeed.
