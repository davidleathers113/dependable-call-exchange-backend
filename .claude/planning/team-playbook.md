### Dependency Coordination Protocol

#### Pre-Sprint Planning
1. **Dependency Mapping**: Each team identifies dependencies
2. **Commitment Protocol**: Providing teams commit to delivery dates
3. **Fallback Planning**: Alternative approaches if dependencies are delayed
4. **Integration Testing**: Shared testing responsibilities

#### During Sprint
1. **Daily Dependency Check**: Teams confirm dependency status
2. **Early Integration**: Integrate as soon as interfaces are stable
3. **Mock Implementation**: Use mocks while waiting for real implementations
4. **Communication**: Immediate notification of dependency delays

#### Dependency Tracking Dashboard
```yaml
# .claude/planning/dependencies.yml
week_1:
  blocking:
    - security_auth_middleware: [compliance, financial, integration]
  non_blocking:
    - compliance_tcpa: [infrastructure]
    
week_2:
  blocking:
