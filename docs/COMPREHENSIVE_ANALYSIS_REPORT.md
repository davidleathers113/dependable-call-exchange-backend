The system implements a modular monolith architecture with clear domain boundaries, event-driven processing, and enterprise-grade scalability features.

## 1. Business Logic Overview

### 1.1 Core Business Model

The platform operates as a real-time marketplace where:
- **Buyers** (typically businesses) pay for incoming calls from potential customers
- **Sellers** (lead generators, affiliates) route calls to buyers through competitive bidding
- **The Exchange** facilitates real-time auctions, ensures compliance, and handles financial transactions

### 1.2 Key Business Processes

#### Call Auction Process
1. **Call Initiation**: Incoming call triggers real-time auction
2. **Bid Matching**: System matches call characteristics with active bid profiles
3. **Auction Execution**: Millisecond-level auction determines winning bid
4. **Call Routing**: Call is routed to winning buyer
5. **Quality Tracking**: Real-time monitoring of call quality and duration
6. **Financial Settlement**: Automatic billing based on call outcome

#### Compliance Management
- **TCPA Compliance**: Time-based calling restrictions
- **DNC List Management**: Real-time Do-Not-Call list checking
- **GDPR Compliance**: Data protection and consent management
- **Geographic Restrictions**: State/country-specific regulations

#### Fraud Prevention
- **ML-based Scoring**: Real-time fraud detection using behavioral patterns
- **Velocity Checks**: Rate limiting and unusual activity detection
- **Quality Metrics**: Historical performance tracking
- **Account Verification**: Multi-level verification process
