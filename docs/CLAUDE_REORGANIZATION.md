# Claude Configuration Reorganization

## Issue Identified
The `.claude/commands/` directory contained a mix of project functionality commands and testing infrastructure commands, creating pollution of the main command namespace.

## Reorganization Status (Updated June 12, 2025)

### ⚠️ INCOMPLETE - Test Commands NOT Moved
**Intended Move:** `/Users/davidleathers/projects/DependableCallExchangeBackEnd/.claude/commands/` → `/Users/davidleathers/projects/DependableCallExchangeBackEnd/test/.claude/commands/`

#### Testing Commands Still in Main Directory:
- `claude-testing-orchestrator.md` - Test suite orchestration
- `claude-testing-review.md` - Test review and analysis

#### Missing Test Commands (No Longer Exist):
- `test-args.md` - Test argument validation
- `test-infinite-original.md` - Testing functionality
- `test-parallel.md` - Testing functionality  
- `test-single-task.md` - Testing functionality
- `examples/` - Directory containing testing examples

### Commands Remaining in Main Project
**Location:** `/Users/davidleathers/projects/DependableCallExchangeBackEnd/.claude/commands/`

#### Project Commands (Unchanged):
- `dce-feature-consent.md` - DCE consent feature implementation
- `dce-feature-parallel.md` - DCE parallel execution feature implementation  
- `dce-feature.md` - DCE general feature implementation
- `dce-master-plan-compliance.md` - DCE compliance planning
- `dce-master-plan.md` - DCE master planning
- `orchestrator.md` - DCE feature specification executor

## Usage After Reorganization

### Testing Commands
Run from the `test/` directory:
```bash
cd test
claude -p "/project:claude-testing-orchestrator"
claude -p "/project:test-args hello world"
```

### Project Commands  
Run from the main project directory:
```bash
cd /Users/davidleathers/projects/DependableCallExchangeBackEnd
claude -p "/project:dce-feature spec_file=docs/specs/feature.md"
claude -p "/project:orchestrator"
```

## Benefits

1. **Clear Separation**: Testing infrastructure is isolated from project functionality
2. **Clean Namespace**: Main project commands are no longer polluted with testing tools
3. **Logical Organization**: Commands are located where they're meant to be used
4. **Maintained Functionality**: All commands continue to work from their new locations

## Verification

Both command sets were tested and confirmed working:
- ✅ Testing commands work from `test/` directory
- ✅ Project commands work from main project directory
- ✅ No functionality lost in the reorganization
