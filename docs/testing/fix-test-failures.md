# Test Failure Resolution Guide

## Root Cause Analysis

The tests are failing because Go is not installed on your system. The error `/opt/homebrew/bin/bash: line 1: go: command not found` indicates that the Go compiler is not available in your PATH.

## Solution Steps

### 1. Install Go

You need to install Go first. On macOS, you can use Homebrew:

```bash
brew install go
```

Or download directly from https://go.dev/dl/ and install Go 1.24 or later (as specified in go.mod).

### 2. Verify Installation

After installation, verify Go is working:

```bash
go version
```

This should show something like `go version go1.24 darwin/arm64`

### 3. Install Project Dependencies

Once Go is installed, navigate to your project directory and run:

```bash
cd /Users/davidleathers/projects/DependableCallExchangeBackEnd
go mod download
go mod verify
```

### 4. Run Tests

Now you can run the tests:

```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Or run tests for specific packages
go test ./internal/domain/account -v
go test ./internal/domain/bid -v
go test ./internal/domain/call -v
go test ./internal/domain/compliance -v
```

## Test Architecture Overview

The test files follow Go best practices:

1. **Test Organization**
   - Tests are in `*_test.go` files alongside the code they test
   - Tests use the `package_test` naming convention for black-box testing
   - Comprehensive test coverage including unit tests, edge cases, and performance tests

2. **Test Utilities** 
   - `internal/testutil/fixtures/` - Builders for creating test data
   - `internal/testutil/mocks/` - Mock implementations for dependencies
   - Table-driven tests for comprehensive coverage

3. **Key Test Patterns**
   - Builder pattern for test data (e.g., `AccountBuilder`, `BidBuilder`)
   - Scenario-based testing (e.g., `AccountScenarios`, `BidScenarios`)
   - Performance benchmarks to ensure sub-millisecond operations
   - Concurrent modification tests for thread safety

## Expected Test Results

Once Go is installed and dependencies are downloaded, all tests should pass. The tests verify:

- Domain logic correctness
- Business rule enforcement
- Performance requirements (< 10µs for entity creation, < 1µs for balance updates)
- Thread safety for concurrent operations
- Edge cases and error handling

## Troubleshooting

If tests still fail after installing Go:

1. **Check Go version**: Ensure you have Go 1.24 or later
2. **Clear module cache**: `go clean -modcache`
3. **Update dependencies**: `go mod tidy`
4. **Check for compilation errors**: `go build ./...`

## Next Steps

After resolving the Go installation issue:

1. Run `make ci` to execute the full CI pipeline
2. Check test coverage with `make coverage`
3. Run benchmarks with `make bench`
4. Ensure all linting passes with `make lint`

The test infrastructure is well-designed and comprehensive. Once Go is properly installed, the tests should provide excellent coverage of the domain logic and help maintain code quality.
