## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

The Dependable Call Exchange Backend implements a **modular monolith** architecture with:

- **Domain-Driven Design** - Clear bounded contexts for each business domain
- **Hexagonal Architecture** - Business logic isolated from infrastructure concerns
- **Event-Driven Processing** - Asynchronous handling for scalability
- **CQRS Pattern** - Optimized read and write models

## üîë Key Components

1. **API Gateway** - Unified entry point with authentication and rate limiting
2. **Core Services**:
   - Call Routing - Intelligent call distribution
   - Bidding Engine - Real-time auction processing
   - Fraud Detection - ML-powered security
   - Compliance - TCPA, GDPR, DNC management
   - Analytics - Real-time metrics and reporting
   - Telephony - SIP/WebRTC integration

3. **Infrastructure**:
   - PostgreSQL with TimescaleDB
   - Redis for caching
   - Kafka for event streaming
   - OpenTelemetry for observability

## üìä Performance Targets

- Call routing decisions: < 1ms
- Bid processing: 100K bids/second
- API response time: < 50ms p99
- Database queries: < 10ms for hot paths

## üîê Security & Compliance

- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- TLS 1.3 encryption
- TCPA time restrictions
- Real-time DNC list checking
- GDPR data protection

## üìà Scalability

- Horizontal scaling of stateless services
- Database read replicas
- Multi-level caching strategy
- Event-driven architecture for decoupling
- Geographic sharding capability
