# CLAUDE.md Refactoring Summary

## What Changed

The CLAUDE.md file has been refactored following Anthropic's best practices to be more concise and focused.

### Previous Structure
- 371 lines with extensive documentation
- Detailed command lists
- Deep technical implementation details
- Comprehensive testing documentation
- AST analysis patterns

### New Structure
- **CLAUDE.md** (98 lines) - Essential project context only
- **QUICK_REFERENCE.md** - Daily commands and patterns
- **TESTING.md** - Comprehensive testing guide
- **docs/AST_ANALYSIS.md** - Tree-sitter analysis patterns

## Why This Change?

Based on Anthropic's documentation:
1. **CLAUDE.md is automatically pulled into context** - Should be concise
2. **Focus on essential information** - Details belong in separate docs
3. **Reference other files** - Don't duplicate content
4. **Maintain easily** - Smaller file is easier to update

## Key Improvements

1. **Better Organization**
   - Information is now in appropriate files
   - Easy to find specific documentation
   - No duplication between files

2. **Faster Context Loading**
   - Smaller CLAUDE.md loads quickly
   - Claude can reference other docs as needed
   - More efficient token usage

3. **Clearer Purpose**
   - CLAUDE.md: Project overview and conventions
   - QUICK_REFERENCE.md: Daily development
   - TESTING.md: Testing details
   - AST_ANALYSIS.md: Advanced analysis

## Migration Notes

- All content from the original CLAUDE.md has been preserved
- Commands are in QUICK_REFERENCE.md
- Testing details are in TESTING.md
- AST patterns are in docs/AST_ANALYSIS.md
- No functionality has been lost

## Best Practices Going Forward

1. **Keep CLAUDE.md focused** on high-level context
2. **Update QUICK_REFERENCE.md** with new common commands
3. **Document details** in appropriate separate files
4. **Reference documentation** rather than duplicating

This refactoring aligns with Anthropic's vision for CLAUDE.md files as described in their documentation and community best practices.
