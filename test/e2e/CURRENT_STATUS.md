# E2E Test Infrastructure - Current Status

## Summary

We successfully implemented a simplified container-to-container networking solution that reduces complexity by 70% (from 867 lines to ~250 lines).

## What's Working

1. **Infrastructure Tests** ✅
   - `TestSimpleComposeApproach` - Passes, spins up PostgreSQL and Redis
   - `TestModularApproach` - Passes, uses testcontainers modules
   - Database connectivity and migrations work correctly

2. **Simplified Implementation** ✅
   - Uses Docker Compose via testcontainers
   - Automatic cleanup
   - Embedded compose configuration
   - All required tables created (accounts, users, api_keys, calls, bids)

## What's Not Working

1. **E2E Tests Requiring API** ❌
   - `TestAuth_EndToEnd` - Fails, expects API at localhost:8080
   - `TestCallExchangeFlow` - Would fail, expects API
   - `TestFinancial` - Would fail, expects API
   - `TestRealTimeEvents` - Would fail, expects WebSocket API

## Root Cause

The simplified implementation only starts infrastructure containers (PostgreSQL, Redis) but not the API container. The E2E tests expect the API to be running at `http://localhost:8080`.

## Solutions

### Option 1: Run API Locally (Recommended for Development)
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start infrastructure
docker-compose up postgres redis

# Terminal 2: Run API
go run main.go

# Terminal 3: Run tests
go test -tags=e2e -v ./test/e2e/...
```

### Option 2: Add API Container Support
Extend `SimpleTestEnvironment` to optionally start the API container:
```go
func (env *SimpleTestEnvironment) StartAPI(t *testing.T) {
    // Build and start API container
    // Update env.APIURL with the correct address
}
```

### Option 3: Mock API for Basic Tests
Create mock endpoints for testing infrastructure without full API:
```go
func StartMockAPI(t *testing.T, port string) *httptest.Server {
    // Return test server with basic endpoints
}
```

## Next Steps

1. **For CI/CD**: Need to decide if API should be:
   - Built into container during tests (slower but isolated)
   - Run as separate process (faster but less isolated)
   - Mocked for basic connectivity tests

2. **For Local Development**: Document that developers should run API locally before E2E tests

3. **For Full Integration**: Could restore API container support but keep it optional

## Test Compilation Status

All tests compile successfully with:
```bash
go test -tags=e2e -c ./test/e2e/...
```

Infrastructure-only tests pass with:
```bash
go test -v -tags=e2e -run TestSimple ./test/e2e/infrastructure/...
```
